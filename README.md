## Breathe description
There are two main pages in the application: 
- for adding text
- for the memorization process

You can add text either by copying or by downloading it directly as a pdf file.

Then the text is loaded and parsed by semantic units so that you have the opportunity to memorize the text in parts.
At the same time, you have the opportunity to move from one to one using the buttons located at the bottom. Soon we will add voice control at all, which will duplicate the functionality of the buttons.

At the moment, these semantic units are visible only on the screen, but in the future it will also be possible to listen to them using voice playback.
